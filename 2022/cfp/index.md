The 5th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim 2022) focuses on all aspects of simulation as a  general paradigm to model and predict spatial systems and generate  spatial data. New simulation methodologies and frameworks, not  necessarily coming from the SIGSPATIAL community, are encouraged to  participate. Also, this workshop is of interest to everyone who works  with spatial data. The simulation methods that will be presented and  discussed in the workshop should find a wide application across the  community by producing benchmark datasets that can be parameterized and  scaled. Simulated data sets will be made available to the community via  the website.

The workshop seeks high-quality full (8-10 pages) and short (up to 4  pages) papers that will be peer-reviewed. Once accepted, at least one  author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL  conference, as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work  which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library.

We solicit novel and previously unpublished research on all topics  related to geospatial simulation including, but not limited to:

- Applications for Spatial Simulation
- Agent Based Models for Spatial Simulation
- Multi-Agent Based Spatial Simulation
- Big Spatial Data Simulation 
- Disease Spread Simulation 
- Spatial Data/Trajectory Generators
- Road Traffic Simulation
- Environmental Simulation
- GIS using Spatial Simulation
- Interactive Spatial Simulation
- Spatial Simulation Parallelization and Distribution
- Geo-Social Simulation and Data Generators
- Social Unrest and Riot Prediction using Simulation
- Spatial Analysis based on Simulation
- Behavioral Simulation
- Verifying and Validating Spatial Simulations
- Urban Simulation
- Digital Twin Simulation


## Special Topic: Climate Change ##


The special topic for GeoSim 2022 brings focus to the impact of climate change from geosimulation's perspective.
