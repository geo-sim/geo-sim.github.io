The 6th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim 2023) focuses on all aspects of simulation 
as a  general paradigm to model and predict spatial systems and generate  spatial data. 
New simulation methodologies and frameworks, not  necessarily coming from the SIGSPATIAL community, 
are encouraged to  participate. Also, this workshop is of interest to everyone who works with spatial data. 
The simulation methods that will be presented and  discussed in the workshop should find a wide application across the 
community by producing benchmark datasets that can be parameterized and scaled. 
Simulated data sets will be made available to the community via the website.

The workshop seeks high-quality full (8-10 pages) and short (up to 4 pages) papers that will be peer-reviewed. 
Once accepted, at least one author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference, 
as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library.

GeoSim 2023 solicits novel and previously
unpublished research on all topics related to geospatial simulation including, but not limited to:

- Applications for Spatial Simulation
- Agent Based Models for Spatial Simulation
- Multi-Agent Based Spatial Simulation
- Big Spatial Data Simulation 
- Disease Spread Simulation 
- Spatial Data/Trajectory Generators
- Road Traffic Simulation
- Environmental Simulation
- GIS using Spatial Simulation
- Interactive Spatial Simulation
- Spatial Simulation Parallelization and Distribution
- Geo-Social Simulation and Data Generators
- Social Unrest and Riot Prediction using Simulation
- Spatial Analysis based on Simulation
- Behavioral Simulation
- Verifying and Validating Spatial Simulations
- Urban Simulation
- Digital Twin Simulation
- Synthetic Population Simulation


## Special Topic: Large Scale Geospatial Simulation ##


Overwhelming challenges such as climate crisis, pandemics, and disasters are complex and convoluted and
impact lives on Earth. To tackle such challenges, multidisciplinary research collaboration is crucial and com-
putational approaches including modeling and simulation play an important role in scientific decision-making.
For more accurate and sophisticated solutions, computational models need to be more granular and involve
many entities, which is computationally intensive. In the meantime, with advances in computing technology
including High-Performance Computing (HPC), cloud computing (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), micro-services, serverless
computing, GPU, TPU, etc, advanced computing has become more prevalent and available ever. Therefore, the
special topic for GeoSim 2023 brings to focus large-scale geospatial simulation. We hope to attract participants
to give paper presentations that showcase a variety of challenges, applications, and methodologies in large-scale
geospatial simulation.
