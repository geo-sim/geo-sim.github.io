The 7th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim 2024) focuses on all aspects of simulation 
as a  general paradigm to model and predict spatial systems and generate  spatial data. 
New simulation methodologies and frameworks, not  necessarily coming from the SIGSPATIAL community, 
are encouraged to  participate. Also, this workshop is of interest to everyone who works with spatial data. 
The simulation methods that will be presented and  discussed in the workshop should find a wide application across the 
community by producing benchmark datasets that can be parameterized and scaled. 
Simulated data sets will be made available to the community via the website.

The workshop seeks high-quality full (8-10 pages) and short (up to 4 pages) papers that will be peer-reviewed. 
Once accepted, at least one author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference, 
as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library.

GeoSim 2024 solicits novel and previously
unpublished research on all topics related to geospatial simulation including, but not limited to:

- Applications for Spatial Simulation
- Agent Based Models for Spatial Simulation
- Multi-Agent Based Spatial Simulation
- Big Spatial Data Simulation 
- Disease Spread Simulation 
- Spatial Data/Trajectory Generators
- Road Traffic Simulation
- Environmental Simulation
- GIS using Spatial Simulation
- Interactive Spatial Simulation
- Spatial Simulation Parallelization and Distribution
- Geo-Social Simulation and Data Generators
- Social Unrest and Riot Prediction using Simulation
- Spatial Analysis based on Simulation
- Behavioral Simulation
- Verifying and Validating Spatial Simulations
- Urban Simulation
- Digital Twin Simulation
- Synthetic Population Simulation

## Paper Format ##

Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). For latex users, please make sure that you choose `sigconf` type (e.g., `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`) in your latex file. Submissions to GeoSim are single-blind -- i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors should be listed in the submitted version.
