Dr. Ovi Chris Rouly holds a Ph.D. in Computational Social Science from George Mason University. He specializes in the simulation of small-group (3-30) and community (30-300) social interaction. His work considers how an individual actor's biological, cognitive, and emotional selves interact in explicit virtual environments to produce emergent stochastic results between the individuals, their environment, and others in their world.
