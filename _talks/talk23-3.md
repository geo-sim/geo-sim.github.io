Land use changes have a major impact on the population, the ecosystem, and the economy. Simulating these changes supports decision makers, e.g., it allows early compensation of negative impacts on the climate and ecosystem. We present a multi-agent system for the simulation. In particular, we model the agents intelligently so that they can find the optimal set of land patches for the new development (a spatial unit allocation problem). We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach providing experiments with real-world data in the region of Erftstadt in Germany.
