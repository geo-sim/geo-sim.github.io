During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media become an important hub for public discussions on vaccination. However, it is unclear how the rise of cyber space (i.e., social media) combined with traditional relational spaces (i.e., social circles), and physical space (i.e., spatial proximity) together affect the diffusion of vaccination opinions and produce different impacts on urban and rural population's vaccination uptake. This research builds an agent-based model utilizing the Mesa framework to simulate individuals' opinion dynamics towards COVID-19 vaccines, their vaccination uptake and the emergent vaccination rates at a macro level for New York State (NYS). By using a spatially explicit synthetic population, our model can accurately simulate the vaccination rates for NYS (mean absolute error=6.93) and for the majority of counties within it (81%). This research contributes to the modeling literature by simulating individuals vaccination behaviors which are important for disease spread and transmission studies. Our study extends geo-simulations into hybrid-space settings (i.e., physical, relational, and cyber spaces).
